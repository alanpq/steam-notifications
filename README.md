steam-notifications provides a replacement for Steam's (not great) notifications by interfacing with dunst. It communicates with Steam as a standard client using DoctorMcKay's [SteamUser](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/node-steam-user), which allows it to handle and create chat notifications.

### Roadmap
- [ ] Customizable notification messages
- [ ] Control panel
- [ ] Dynamic notification triggers (specific users only, etc.)
